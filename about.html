  <h2 class="editable">Our Mission</h2>
  <p class="editable">
    BeachCity’s mission is to reimagine and redefine the role of digital media in developing entrepreneurial capability and bringing together communities.<br /><br />We believe in highlighting both the joys and challenges of entrepreneurship, and we're not scared to leave the story a little unpolished so the truth shines through. In the age of hype, authenticity is how we can form connections in a globalised, digital world.<br /><br />With a focus on technology and innovation, we cover events, conduct interviews, develop education programs and build global networks to support the new generation of rising entrepreneurs. We shine a spotlight on and share stories from aspiring and inspiring entrepreneurs from schools and universities as well as early-stage ventures all the way to corporate intrapreneurs.<br /><br />By working with business associations, incubators, development agencies, governments and other changemakers to create entrepreneurial lifestyle media for the Youtube generation, we're helping to bridge the gap between traditional institutions of support and new, self-driven journeys of learning.
