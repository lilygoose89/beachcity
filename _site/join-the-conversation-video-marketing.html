  <h2>Are you a part of the conversations that matter to your customers?</h2>
  <p>
    The way brands acquire new audiences online has changed. It's no longer enough to scream for attention with ads that interrupt users, the new generation demands engaging content of value. This requires a radical new way of thinking on the part of marketing and communication teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    The question these days isn't "how can we grab our share of attention?" it should be "how do we show up in the stories our customers are creating, consuming and sharing?"
  </p>
  <h3>It's time to join the conversation.</h3>
  <p>
    Producing high-quality live social videos is a powerful way to reach the most coveted demographic groups online. Featuring people that they trust and topics they're passionate about, these videos engage audiences who tap into the power of social networks to amplify and distribute.
  </p>
  <h3>
    And if you can insert yourself into those videos in a way that's organic and feels authentic to viewers?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Well that's what we'd call a win win.

    <h2>If video isn't already part of your marketing mix, here's why it should be.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        By 2022, online videos will make up more than 82% of all consumer internet traffic (15x higher than it was in 2017!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Every minute, 72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube.
      </li>
      <li>
        One billion hours of video is watched daily on YouTube. Yes, billion with a 'b.'
      </li>
      <li>
        When asked, “Are you the kind of person who likes advertising?,” 84% of millenials say ‘No.’
      </li>
      <li>
        58% of millenials, however, don't mind sponsored posts supporting their favorite channels.
      </li>
      <li>
        53% of users reported engaging with a brand after viewing a video on social media. For millenials, that rate jumps up to 66%.
      </li>
      <li>
        Social video generates 12 times more shares than text and images combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        51% of marketing professionals worldwide name video as the type of content with the best ROI.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The new internet isn't spammy and filled with advertising, it's engaging and authentic. That's why storytelling, something old as time, is having it's moment again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, we've always trusted people more than advertisers and the rise of influencer marketing demonstrates how technology has become an extention of how we interact with the world.

  <h2>If you're only investing in perfectly polished promo-videos, then it's time to have another think about your strategy...</h2>
  <p>
    The type of content you produce directly impacts its success. The proliferation of media and videos means its a consumer's market. If you don't tell stories audiences want to hear, you'll get buried, blocked and unfollowed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, if you try to trick or deceive your audiences, you're likely to get backlash. It all goes back to <i>authenticity</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The marketers who succeed in the brave new world of video know how to tap into the moment. To engage audiences on their own turf in a way thats genuine and feels organic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider these video marketing stats:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      65% of viewers skip online video ads as soon as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      33% of viewers will stop watching a video after 30 seconds, 45% by one minute, and 60% by two minutes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    What are some takeaways from that? For one, if you're only investing in video content for pre-roll ads, all you're doing is interrupting people and getting in the way of what they want, which is to learn or be entertained.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some takeaways from an Adobe study on sponsored content:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The fit between the site and the brand is critical to success with consumers.
    </li>
    <li>
      In-feed sponsored content is most useful for established brands that seek to enhance and
      differentiate their image, deepen existing consumer relationships, to launch brand
      extensions.
    </li>
    <li>
      The best in-feed sponsored content tells a story and fulfills the human need for a
      compelling narrative.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Branded content gets more attention and creates brand recognition. Consumers like branded content because they believe the content is more consumer-focused. Since the message isn’t a sales pitch, it creates trust between the brand and the consumer. Traditional advertising does not have the same outcome.</p>
  <p>
    New media moves at the speed of light. By the time you've produced and polished that slick promo video, the conversation has moved on. Audiences don't want to hear abut something after the fact - they want to be the first to know and be there as the story unfolds.
