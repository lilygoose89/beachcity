  <h2>Are you part of the conversations that matter to your customers?</h2>
  <p>The way brands acquire new audiences online has changed. It's no longer enough to scream for attention with ads that interrupt users, the new generation demands engaging content of value. This requires a radical new way of thinking on the part of marketing and communication teams.</p>
  <blockquote class="margin-bottom-s">The question these days isn't "how can we grab our share of attention?" it should be "how do we show up in the stories our customers are creating, consuming and sharing?"</blockquote>
  <h3>It's time to join the conversation.</h3>
  <p>Producing high-quality live social videos is a powerful way to reach the most coveted demographic groups online. Featuring people that they trust and topics they're passionate about, these videos engage audiences who tap into the power of social networks to amplify and distribute.</p>
  <p>And if you can insert yourself into those videos in a way that's organic and feels authentic to viewers?</p>
  <p>Well, that's what we'd call a win-win.</p>

  <h2>Our takeaways? Invest in video content that actually wins new customers.</h2>
  <p>Content that connects serves the desires of your audience,&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;the desires of your brand.</p>
  <p>The proliferation of media and videos means it's a consumer's market. If you don't tell stories audiences want to hear, you'll get buried, blocked and unfollowed. Users have a goal in mind when they go online. Instead of barging in the way and interrupting them, create content that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the goal.</p>
  <blockquote>Brand videos that go viral are the ones that inspire, educate and entertain, not the ones that shout "Look at us! We're awesome."</blockquote>
  <p>The marketers who succeed in this brave new world of video know how to engage audiences on their own turf in a way that's genuine and feels organic. They also know how to tap into the moment - and, by the way, live video is an excellent way to do that.</p>
  <p>Conversations online move at the speed of light and audiences don't want to hear about something after the fact - they want to be the first to know and be there as the story unfolds. Why spend thousands on a slick promo video if it's going to take weeks or months to produce and your audience has moved on?</p>
  <p>Quality content doesn't mean something perfectly produced and packaged. If you have something interesting to say, all you need to create quality content and connect with your audience is a smartphone (and maybe some decent lighting).</p>
  <blockquote>Audiences will happily sacrifice production value for <em>content value.&nbsp;</em></blockquote>
  <p><em></em>In fact, audiences nowadays prefer something raw and unvarnished. Partly this is pushback against advertiser driven ideals of perfection, but also - this is the type of video digital natives are creating and sharing amongst themselves!</p>
  <p>In the end, though, it all comes down to your marketing goals.</p>
  <p>Want to increase engagement on your website and landing pages? Then, by all means, produce that slick promo video. Want to improve conversion with client testimonials that talk about why you're the best at X, Y &amp; Z? Awesome, nothing builds trust like social proof.</p>
  <p>These types of video should be important arms of your strategy, but what's often missing is <em>content that puts brands in front of a new audience</em>.</p>
  <p>So how do you do that?</p>
  <blockquote>If you want to grow your audience, you need to <i>be where your customers are</i> or create the space they want to engage in</blockquote>
  <p>Get to know your customers, dive into the topics they're talking about and explore the channels they're having those discussions on. If you can meaningfully contribute to those conversations, you're delivering on the fundamental essence of content marketing.</p>
  <p>Creating brand awareness and building trust by providing value, entertainment and insight.</p>
  <h3>It's all about being part of the conversation!</h3>
