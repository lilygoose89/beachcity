  <h2>Are you a part of the conversations that matter to your customers?</h2>
  <p>
    The way brands acquire new audiences online has changed. It's no longer enough to scream for attention with ads that interrupt users, the new generation demands engaging content of value. This requires a radical new way of thinking on the part of marketing and communication teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    The question these days isn't "how can we grab our share of attention?" it should be "how do we show up in the stories our customers are creating, consuming and sharing?"
  </p>
  <h3>It's time to join the conversation.</h3>
  <p>
    Producing high-quality live social videos is a powerful way to reach the most coveted demographic groups online. Featuring people that they trust and topics they're passionate about, these videos engage audiences who tap into the power of social networks to amplify and distribute.
  </p>
  <h3>
    And if you can insert yourself into those videos in a way that's organic and feels authentic to viewers?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Well that's what we'd call a win win.

    <h2>If video isn't already part of your marketing mix, here's why it should be.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        By 2020, 83% of global internet traffic will be driven by video.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every minute, 72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube.
      </li>
      <li>
        One billion hours of video is watched daily on YouTube. Yes, billion with a 'b.'
      </li>
      <li>
        When asked, “Are you the kind of person who likes advertising?,” 84% of millenials say ‘No.’
      </li>
      <li>
        58% of millenials, however, don't mind sponsored posts supporting their favorite channels.
      </li>
      <li>
        53% of users reported engaging with a brand after viewing a video on social media. For millenials, that rate jumps up to 66%.
      </li>
      <li>
        Social video generates 12 times more shares than text and images combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        51% of marketing professionals worldwide name video as the type of content with the best ROI.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The new internet isn't spammy and filled with advertising, it's engaging and authentic. That's why storytelling, something old as time, is having it's moment again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, we've always trusted people more than advertisers and the rise of influencer marketing demonstrates how technology has become an extention of how we interact with the world.

  <h2>The Challenges of Video Marketing</h2>
  <p>
    So if video is so important, then why aren't more brands doing it? It's not a level playing field and simply just doing social video is no guarantee of success. The chatter from marketers brings the challenges of video marketing down to four key points.
  </p>
  <h3>1. It's Resource Intensive</h3>
  <p>
    43% of marketers said they’d create more video content if there were no obstacles like time, resources, and budget. As with any form of content marketing, you can do it quick and cheap, but if you want quality, that takes either time or money. If you were even thinking about it though, quality is really not something you can sacrifice nowadays.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given the increasing amounts of noise and seemingly exponential growth of online content, only the best can succeed. That's not just a truism or a hunch, that's a Google-vetted fact and baked into their latest updates which prioritize content that is longer, more in-depth, insightful or otherwise engaging.
  </p>
  <h3>2. You Have to Develop a Whole New Competency - Production & Storytelling</h3>
  <p>
    We've mentioned before that audiences crave authenticity. This is both a blessing and a burden on the production front for brands.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the plus side, one of the ways to come across as authentic on social and video platforms is to keep it simple. Instead of shelling out for expensive equipment and post-production, shooting and uploading from your smartphone, the same way that regular users do, can actually get better results.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a brand, you should consider how authenticity comes across in the actual content of your videos as well. Audiences have their own interests in mind and while they may engage with your website by viewing testimonial videos this type of content will do little to nothing to draw in new customers. They serve a purpose, but that purpose is not to go viral.
  </p>
  <h3>3. Establishing Credibility Takes Time</h3>
  <p>
    Content marketing, whether it's blogging or video marketing, does not typically yield instant results for the brand. It's playing the long game and letting potential customers know that you're willing to give them value in order to build trust.
  </p>
  <p>
    Brands that stick to this though reap major benefits over time. The thing about content is that while it can be expensive to produce, quality content has a long tail. A one-time ad spend may get a quick hit of customers, but a good how-to blog post, engaging podcast, or viral video interview will keep sending you traffic for, potentially, years to come.
  </p>
  <h3>4. Distribution Ain't Easy</h4>
  <p>
    Once you have the resources to create content and you develop or buy the production chops needed to create it, then the next challenge is getting it out in front of an audience. With organic reach diminishing on social media, just getting content out to your own followers these days might require boosting and ads, all this with no guarantee of even reaching a new audience!
  </p>
  <p>
    This goes back to that old chestnut, engagement. If your content is engaging, people will share it. As long as you optimize your copy, callouts and hashtags for social, you're giving it the best chance of going gangbusters on the web. A little paid boost, if targeted strategically, can go a long way and exploring ways to access additional channels also gives you more avenues for promotion.
